### 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game

A classic grid-based strategy game—built for quick fun and easy competition!

#### 🧩 Game Modes

- **👥 Two-Player Mode:** Challenge a friend locally and see who claims the grid with Xs and Os.
- **🤖 Play vs Computer:** Go solo against an unpredictable, *slightly clueless* opponent. It makes random moves and doesn't exactly plan ahead—but that just makes the victory sweeter!

#### 🛠 Tech Highlights

- Built using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- Responsive grid layout with click-to-play functionality
- Game logic includes win detection, turn-based control, and dynamic UI
- Fully playable on both desktop and mobile browsers

#### 🚧 Known Limitations

- The computer player uses random moves—it doesn't strategize or block intelligently
- No scoring system or difficulty levels (yet!)
